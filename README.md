# Bank Management System
<br>

 Demo-> https://github.com/Ishika411/Bank-Management-system

This code implements a Bank Management System in C++. It provides the structure and partial functionality for managing basic banking operations such as account creation, user authentication, and administrative controls. The system uses file handling to store and retrieve user data persistently from a text file (bank.txt), allowing users to create accounts and administrators to manage banking functionalities.
This program serves as a prototype for a banking system that can be extended into a full-fledged solution. It demonstrates key banking features such as account management and transaction handling, making it useful for educational purposes, small-scale banking operations, or as a foundation for larger systems. With enhancements like database integration, encryption, and a refined UI, it can evolve into a professional banking solution for managing customers, transactions, and financial records securely.
